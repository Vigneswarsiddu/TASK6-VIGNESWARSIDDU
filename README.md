#### COMPANY: KAIBURR

#### QUESTION: Task 6. Data Science example.
Perform a Text Classification on consumer complaint dataset
(https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/consumer-complaint-database) into following categories.
0 Credit reporting, repair, or
other
1 Debt collection
2 Consumer Loan
3 Mortgage
Steps to be followed -
1. Explanatory Data Analysis and Feature Engineering
2. Text Pre-Processing
3. Selection of Multi Classification model
4. Comparison of model performance
5. Model Evaluation
6. Prediction

#### SOLUTION:
##### My Understanding of the Dataset:
This is a supervised text classification issue because each complaint is associated with a distinct product. We applied various machine learning algorithms to create more precise predictions in order to categorize future complaints.

##### My work outlook:
Complaints are the predefined categories,
Algorithms used: Linear Support Vector Machine, Multinomial Naive Bayes.

##### STEP 1: Download Dataset from the source: https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/consumer-complaint-database [and I'm using Google Collaboratory Notebook, and I will access the dataset from the MyDrive I'm uploaded]
##### Loading and Importing the libraries
